      <h4>Project Goals</h4>
      <p>
        Almost seven years ago, Ryan a.k.a. Barack Odrama a.k.a. The Dalai Drama started working at Hall and Partners, a marketing research firm. His manager, McKenzie, was a big music fan, but did not like rap music. A former hip-hop DJ, Ryan set out to change McKenzie's mind about the genre. He created a mixed CD (because CDs were still the medium of choice) with ten of his favorite rap songs, along with a description of each song's history, lyrics, and significance. McKenzie thanked Ryan for the CD, but that was the last he heard about it... Five years later, McKenzie and Ryan had become great friends, and McKenzie invited Ryan over for Thanksgiving dinner. To Ryan's great surprise and delight, the soundtrack to dinner was the CD he had made for McKenzie years earlier! The goal of this project is to help non-rap fans develop an appreciation for the genre. Welcome!
